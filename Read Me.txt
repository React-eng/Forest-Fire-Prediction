Read Me file for the project:

This project is a capstone project for an initiative taken by California State University ( Fullerton) for combating the damage done by Forest fires in California. The first step of the project was
1. Creating and understanding the Matlab reports of classification. ( I have focused my own dataset as I wanted to deploy the model using 'Rule of 30') 
2. Once the reports are satisfactory I used Sklearn package with SVM classifier.
3. The binary Classification model is trained for the target class 'Fire'= 1, and 'No Fire' = '0' and the predictions are achieved using predict_proba.
4. As my front end was expected to be an android Application, I have converted the predictions using json package.

The second step was to create the front end genrally found in App.js
1. I am getting my Temperature, Pressure, Humidity and sending them as a json object back to my Flask Api.
2. Once that is done I used POSTMAN to flash my front end to the Web and then connected to the Backend.
3. The response received from the Flask Backend is then displayed using the ALERT.

The third step is still under process as I have completed the project successfuly, now I want to add more pages and use the location to alert near by fire stations.
Also I am planning to add a ' ChatBot ' application using React so that people who are away from the place of fire ( assuming they are not present at their property )  can notify the fire fighters/ helpers to take care of any pets or valueable assets left back at home

Any opinions or additional comments would be great!
